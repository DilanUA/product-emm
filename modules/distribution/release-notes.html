<h1>WSO2 Enterprise Mobility Manager (EMM) ${product.version} Release Notes</h1>

<p>
    WSO2 EMM is a unique mobile solution that is open source, user-friendly and distributed under the Apache Software 
    License v2.0. WSO2 EMM includes two components: Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM). 
    MDM enables organizations to secure, manage and monitor Android and iOS powered devices (e.g., smart phones, ipod 
    touch devices and tablet PCs), irrespective of the mobile operator, service provider, or the organization. MAM enables 
    organizations to manage mobile application (app) life cycles via the Publisher, distribute mobile apps to users 
    registered with MDM via the Store, and manage mobile apps (i.e., install and uninstall in bulk, blacklist, and more) 
    via the MAM Console. EMM, maintains a compliance monitoring process to detect devices that are non-compliant to the 
    assigned policy. In addition, EMM supports SSO and multi-tenancy.
