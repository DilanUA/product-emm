<h1>Enterprise Mobility Manager ${product.version} Release Notes</h1>

<p>
    
WSO2 Enterprise Mobility Manager (EMM) is a unique solution designed to specifically address the mobile enterprise needs. EMM includes of two key components: Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM). WSO2 EMM also supports single sign-on (SSO) and multi-tenancy. 
MDM enables organizations to secure, manage and monitor Android and iOS powered devices (i.e., smart phones, ipod touch devices and tablet PCs), irrespective of the mobile operator, service provider, or the organization. Users need to accept the Policy agreement, which states all the actions that can be carried out on the device when enrolling with MDM. MDM only controls the corporate data that is present on the devices, while the personal data is left untouched.
